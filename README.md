## Project Pitch
Look up local breweries by city, state, or ZIP code.

## User Stories
As a user, I can search for local breweries by toggling between city, state, or zip code and then search based on a provided input.

As a user, I can click on the name of a brewery and find additional information about it, such as address, phone number, and website.
